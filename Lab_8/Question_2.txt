Lab_8 Question 2:
When you get a vue error stating somthing was accessed during render 
but is not defined on instance, it means that a piece of data that the program is trying to use was 
created but is not properly coded in some way that is not allowing the webpage to access it. For example,
a variable name could be misspelled somewhere or it might not have been added to the return statement.
