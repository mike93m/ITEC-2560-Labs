Lab_8 Question 2:
When you get a vue error stating somthing was accessed during render but is not defined on instance, 
it means that a piece of data that the program is trying to use was created but is not properly coded 
in some way that is not allowing the webpage to access it. Can you ignore it? If the webpage is still 
in development and you were only trying to test certain features that are not dependent on the undefined 
element than yes you could ignore it but it must be corrected in order for the page to be fully functional. 
Some of the ways this issue could be corrected are to ensure that all variables are spelled the same and 
that they have all been included in the return statement of the Vue app setup code.
