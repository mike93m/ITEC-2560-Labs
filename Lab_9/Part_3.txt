After reviewing both the original vanilla JS student_club_roster and the new version, I am still unsure which I prefer.
As far as ease of coding goes I would say that using plain JS is easier and in the case of the student_club_roster page 
it was actually faster. My original file contains 138 lines of code while the Vue version has 199 lines. While I can see
how certain aspects of Vue may seem easier at the end of the day if you have to write more code is it really? While I do 
understand the point of creating the same page using 2 different methods, I feel that maybe there is a better type of webpage
to show how Vue can be superior to plain JS because the student_club_roster example would definitely not be enough to sway 
me into using Vue. I remember in one of the videos, Clara showed a good example of how plain JS can get a bit 
messy when you have lots of nested code but for student_club_rostor that was not a factor and therfore it didnt help portray
one method as being better than the other. One of the aspects I like about Vue is not having to create an event listener for
things like button clicks, however, to reiterate my previous point, If it takes longer(more lines) to code than it doesnt really
matter how many usefull features it has. Unless I was creating a complicated page with lots
